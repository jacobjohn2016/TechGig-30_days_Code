## 1. Hello TechGig

[Solution](1-Hello.cpp)

### References

[GFG - Getline](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getline-string-c/)

### Syntax

```cpp
istream& getline(istream& is, string& str, char delim);
```

1. `is`: Object of istream class. Tells the function about the stream from where to read the input from.
2. `str`: String object. Input is stored in this object after being read from the stream.
3. `delim`: Delimitation character. Tells the function to stop reading further input after reaching this character.

## 2. Exploring Data Types
